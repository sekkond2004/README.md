            <h2>Ekko's Description:</h2>
            <p>A prodigy from the rough streets of Zaun, Ekko is able to 
                manipulate time to twist any situation to his advantage. 
                He uses his own invention, the Z-Drive, to explore the 
                branching possibilities of reality, crafting the perfect 
                moment to seemingly achieve the impossible the first time, 
                every time. Though Ekko revels in this freedom, when there's 
                a threat to those he cares about, he and the Firelights will 
                do anything to defend them.

                    <li>Zero-Drive (Z-Drive)</li>
                    <li>Giant Clock's Hour Hand</li>

            <h2>Ekko's Abilities:</h2>
            <ul>
                <h3><li>Z-Drive Resonance (Passive)</li></h3>
                    <p>Every third attack or damaging spell on the same 
                        target deals bonus magic damage, and grants Ekko 
                        a burst of speed if the target is a champion.</p>
                <h3><li>Time Winder</li></h3>
                    <p>Ekko throws a temporal grenade that expands into a 
                        time-distortion field upon hitting an enemy 
                        slowing and damaging anyone caught inside. 
                        After a delay, the grenade rewinds back to Ekko, 
                        dealing damage on its return.</p>
                <h3><li>Parallel Convergence</li></h3>
                    <p>Ekko's basic attacks deal bonus magic damage to 
                        low health enemies. He can cast Parallel 
                        Convergence to split the timeline, creating an 
                        anomaly after a few seconds that slows enemies 
                        caught inside. If Ekko enters the anomaly, he 
                        gains shielding and stuns enemies by suspending 
                        them in time.</p>
                <h3><li>Phase Dive</li></h3>
                    <p>Ekko rolls evasively while charging up his Z-Drive. 
                        His next attack deals bonus damage and warps 
                        reality, teleporting him to his target.</p>
                <h3><li>Chronobreak (Ultimate)</li></h3>
                    <p>Ekko shatters his timeline, becoming untargetable 
                        and rewinding to a more favorable point in time. 
                        He returns to whenever he was a few seconds ago, 
                        and heals for a percentage of the damage received 
                        in that duration. Enemies near his arrival zone 
                        take massive damage.</p>
